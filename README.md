Kindly run the Program.rb file to see the program.<br>

-----Problem Statement-----<br>
On a retail website, the following discounts apply:<br>
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount <br>
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount <br>
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount. <br>
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45 as a discount). <br>
5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries. <br>
6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.  <br>

Write a program with test cases such that given a bill, it finds the net payable amount. <br>
Please note the stress is on object oriented approach and test coverage.
